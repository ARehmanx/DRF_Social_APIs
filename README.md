# DRF_Social_Auth
Simple Module for Social Authentication in Django Rest Framework using dj-rest-auth Package.

This includes simple Sigup and Login APIs and also the Social Signup with Facebook Google and Apple.
The Pacakges I have used :
1. django-allauth
2. dj-rest-auth

Sooner I will create a copy paste version for this. Which you can directly add to your project by installing the required packages.

Thanks for being here..
