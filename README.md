# DRF_Social_Auth
Simple Module for Social Authentication in Django Rest Framework using dj-rest-auth Package.

This includes simple Sigup and Login APIs and also the Social Signup with Facebook Google and Apple. Also I have added Social Connect functionality. Which might be helpful for you guys. If dont need it just comment or remove this method  https://github.com/ARehmanx/DRF_Social_Auth/blob/0be416526f7e9675ab3e6882e9d4e801abbc5fc4/social/adapters.py#L19

The Pacakges I have used :
1. django-allauth
2. dj-rest-auth

Sooner I will create a copy paste version for this. Which you can directly add to your project by installing the required packages.

Thanks for being here..
